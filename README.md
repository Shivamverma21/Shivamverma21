Hi there, I'm Shivam verma! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a keen interest in building efficient, scalable and user-friendly applications. Here's a little about me and what I do:


🔭 I’m currently working on building in-memory Databases like Redis and learning low level design patterns which could be useful to develop decoupled and scalable systems.

🌱 I’m always learning and enhancing my skills in Java Spring Boot, React, and modern backend and frontend development.

⚡ Fun fact: I prefer stupid solutions and love optimizing code for performance.
